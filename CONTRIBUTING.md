## Setup

1. Fork the repo (click the <kbd>Fork</kbd> button at the top right of [this page](https://github.com/type-route/type-route))
2. Clone your fork locally

```bash
# in a terminal, cd to parent directory where you want your clone to be, then
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/type-route.git
cd type-route
```

3. Install project dependencies. Type Route uses `npm`, so you should too. If you install using `yarn`, an unnecessary `yarn.lock` file will be generated.

```bash
npm install
```

4. Install documentation website dependencies.

```bash
cd website
npm install
```
